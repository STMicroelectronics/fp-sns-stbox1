# FP-SNS-STBOX1 Firmware Package

![latest tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/STMicroelectronics/fp-sns-stbox1.svg?color=brightgreen)

The FP-SNS-STBOX1 is STM32Cube Function Pack for:
- SensorTile.box PRO discovery box with multi-sensors and wireless connectivity (STEVAL-MKBOXPRO) 
- STWIN.BOX Industrial Node Development Kit (STEVAL-STWINBX1) 
The purpose of this functional pack is to provide simple applications and examples that show how to build custom applications for STEVAL-MKBOXPRO Pro Mode and STEVAL-STWINBX1.

The expansion is built on STM32Cube software technology to ease portability across different STM32 microcontrollers.

**FP-SNS-STBOX1 software features**:

- Complete examples and applications to develop node with BLE connectivity, analog microphone, environmental and motion sensors, and perform real-time monitoring of sensors and audio data
- Example of how create one Boot Loader and one application for allowing Firmware Over the Air update
- Firmware compatible with ST BLE Sensor applications for Android/iOS, to perform sensor data reading, motion algorithm features demo and firmware update (FOTA)
- Easy portability across different MCU families, thanks to STM32Cube
- Free, user-friendly license terms

## Supported Devices and Boards

- STEVAL-MKBOXPRO (SensorTile.box PRO) discovery box with multi-sensors and wireless connectivity for any intelligent IoT node\[[STEVAL-MKBOXPRO](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-mkboxpro.html)\]
- STEVAL-STWINBX1 (STWIN.box) SensorTile Wireless Industrial Node Development Kit \[[STEVAL-STWINBX1](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-mksbox1v1.html)\]

## Known Limitations

With some Android phones there are some compatibility issues for:

- using the PIN for BLE security connection (BLEDualProgram application). In this case disable the STBOX1_BLE_SECURE_CONNECTION on respective Inc/STBOX1_config.h file

- for forcing a full BLE rescan (BLEMLC). In this case disable the BLE_FORCE_RESCAN on their Inc/STBOX1_config.h files

In all these situations, before to connect to the SensorTile.box, each time you change the running application, clean the Device Cache for forcing a rescan of BLE services:

## Development Toolchains and Compilers

-   IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM (EWARM) toolchain V9.20.1 + STLink/V2 or STLink/V3
-   RealView Microcontroller Development Kit (MDK-ARM) toolchain V5.38.0 + ST-LINK/V2 or STLink/V3
-   Integrated Development Environment for STM32 (STM32CubeIDE) V1.15.1 + ST-LINK or STLink/V3
