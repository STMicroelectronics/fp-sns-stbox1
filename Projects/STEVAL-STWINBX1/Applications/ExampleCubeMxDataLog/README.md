## <b>ExampleCubeMxDataLog Application Description for STEVAL-STWINBX1 (STWIN.box) evaluation board</b>

This firmware package includes Components Device Drivers, Board Support Package and example application for the following STMicroelectronics elements:

  - STEVAL-STWINBX1 (STWIN.box) evaluation board that contains the following components:
      - MEMS sensor devices: IIS2DLPC, IIS2MDC, IIS3DWB, ISM330DHCX, IIS2ICLX, ILPS22QS, STTS22H
	  - ST25dv 64K
      - analog/digital microphone 
 
The Example application provides one CubeMX example of one simple Data Logger that reads the sensors' values and prints the output on one Serial port with the following configuration

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bit
- Parity: None
- Stop Bits: 1 bit
- Flow control: None

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>
