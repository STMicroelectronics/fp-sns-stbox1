## <b>SDDataLogFileX Application Description for STEVAL-MKBOXPRO (SensorTile.box-Pro) evaluation board</b>

This firmware package includes Components Device Drivers, Board Support Package and example application for the following STMicroelectronics elements:

  - STEVAL-MKBOXPRO (SensorTile.box-Pro) evaluation board that contains the following components:
      - MEMS sensor devices: STTS22H, LPS22DF, LSM6DSV16X, LIS2DU12, LIS2MDL
	  - Dynamic NFC tag: ST25DV04K (board rev. A) - ST25DV64KC (board rev .B)
	  - On-board Bluetooth® Low Energy 5.2: BlueNRG-LP
      - Digital Microphone: MP23db01HP  
 
The Example application provides one example of one simple SD Data logger
Pressing the User Button is possible to start/stop the logger
For each log session, the board saves:

- one .wav file that it's the output of the digital microphone
- one .csv file with the sensors logged at 100Hz 

### <b>Keywords</b>

NFC, SPI, I2C, UART, MEMS, BLE, BLE_Manager, BlueNRGLP

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

- This example runs on STEVAL-MKBOXPRO (SensorTile.box-Pro) evaluation board and it can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

### <b>Known Issues</b>

- The firmware doesn't suite with STM32CubeMX
- Beware of a warning on STM32CubeIDE v1.15.1 during compilation: "SDDataLogFileX.elf has a LOAD segment with RWX permissions"

### <b>Dependencies</b>

STM32Cube packages:

  - STM32U5xx drivers from STM32CubeU5 V1.5.0
  
STEVAL-MKSBOX1V1:

  - STEVAL-MKBOXPRO V1.2.0

### <b>How to use it?</b>

This package contains projects for 3 IDEs viz- IAR, Keil µVision 5 and Integrated Development Environment for STM32.
In order to make the  program work, you must do the following:

 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.

For IAR:

 - Open IAR toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with Embedded Workbench V9.20.1).
 - Open the IAR project file on EWARM directory
 - Rebuild all files and Flash the binary on STEVAL-MKBOXPRO

For Keil µVision 5:

 - Open Keil µVision 5 toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with MDK-ARM Professional Version: 5.38.0).
 - Open the µVision project file on MDK-ARM directory
 - Rebuild all files and Flash the binary on STEVAL-MKBOXPRO
		
For Integrated Development Environment for STM32:

- Open STM32CubeIDE (this firmware has been successfully tested with Version 1.15.1)
 - Set the default workspace proposed by the IDE (please be sure that there are not spaces in the workspace path).
 - Press "File" -> "Import" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace"; press "Browse" in the "Select root directory" and choose the path where the STM32CubeIDE project is located (it should be STM32CubeIDE\).
 - Rebuild all files and and Flash the binary on STEVAL-MKBOXPRO
